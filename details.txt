KCET College Recommendation System
Developed an intelligent recommendation system to assist KCET aspirants in selecting colleges based on their entrance exam ranks, reservation category, and preferred department.
Engineered a robust data processing pipeline that cleansed and pre-processed cutoff data, handling missing values and ensuring data integrity, using Python and Pandas.
Implemented k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to accurately predict and rank college options into two categories: those more likely and less likely to offer admission based on historical cutoff trends.
Integrated a user-friendly web interface using Flask, allowing users to input their rank, category, and department, and receive personalized college recommendations.
Performed data integration and visualization by merging college cutoff data with college metadata, providing comprehensive and easily understandable outputs.
Designed and developed the front-end using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and intuitive user experience.
Enhanced performance and scalability of the recommendation system by optimizing the k-NN model parameters and implementing efficient data handling techniques.
Managed the complete software development lifecycle from requirement analysis and data collection to model deployment and testing, ensuring high-quality deliverables.
Deployed the application on a local server for demonstration purposes, with capabilities for future deployment to cloud platforms such as AWS or Heroku.
Demonstrated advanced proficiency in full-stack development, machine learning, and data analytics through successful implementation and testing of the system.
